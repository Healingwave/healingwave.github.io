    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>
      Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as
      anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the
      websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may
      use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect
      information and improve their services. You have the option to either
      accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to
      your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to
      use some portions of this Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this app.
      Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this
      app, what screens they visit when they do so, and what other apps they
      used prior to coming to this app. We use the information we get from
      Google Analytics only to improve this app. Google Analytics collects only
      the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this app, rather than
      your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the
      information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally
      identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent
      cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time
      you visit this app, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.
      Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google
      Analytics about your visits to this app is restricted by the Google
      Analytics Terms of Use (as amended for government webapps) and the Google
      Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
    <p>
      I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following
      reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
      <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
      <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
      <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have
      access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
      assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
      disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p>
      I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are
      striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But
      remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of
      electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its
      absolute security.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
    <p>
      This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a
      third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these
      external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
      review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and
      assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices
      of any third-party sites or services.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
    <div>
      <p>
        These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not
        knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
        under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has
        provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from
        our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your
        child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so
        that I will be able to do the necessary actions.
